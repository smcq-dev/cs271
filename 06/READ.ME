This project is a hack assembly language assembler and parser. 
Here is what you need to know about the assembler functionality:

main.c is the driver program. This file controls the output that you will get when you run the 
program from the command line. Hence, you should use the main.exe file that is generated with you run the
makefile. In order to run the program on a specific .asm file from the command line, you must run main.exe first,
then enter the relevant asm file. Ex: main.exe asm\Add.asm (assuming Add.asm is in the subdirectory asm). 
Main.c calls all relevant files that are required for the assembler and parser to work. The assembler will create a 
.hack file for the respective asm file that you run from the command line. It will store itself in the same directory as it's asm file. 
In the .hack file, there will be 16 bit binary instructions that represent the instructions written on the relevant line of the .asm file in machine code.
